I'm a final-year undergraduate student pursuing a BSc (Hons.) in Software Engineering at the University of Plymouth, United Kingdom, while based in beautiful Sri Lanka at NSBM Green University. My academic journey has equipped me with a diverse set of skills and experiences, allowing me to explore a wide range of technologies and software development paradigms.

🚀 Here's a glimpse of what I've been up to:

- 🌐 Proficient in various programming languages including Python, C/C#, Java, and JavaScript.
- 📱 Experienced with mobile app development in Android Studio using Java and Kotlin.
- 💻 Developed web applications using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Angular.
- 🌱 Explored the world of cross-platform app development with Flutter.
- 🌐 Worked with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack for group projects.
- 🎓 Graduating soon with a strong foundation in software engineering and a passion for innovation.

🔥 I'm enthusiastic about the endless possibilities that technology offers, and I'm eager to collaborate on exciting projects and contribute to open-source initiatives.
